# MCMC (Mass Cooperative Micro Computing)
---

MCMC is next generation open source computer architecture.
MCMC means Mass Cooperative Micro Computing.

## About MCMC
---

MCMC consists of a large amount of small devices equipped parts of a micro computer (or Micro Processor Unit).
Mass devices (some of them have different parts) cooperatively work as complete computers.
The goal is to develop a platform of mass devices cooperative computing.

### MCMC and IoT
MCMC stands on communications of things in a machine language.
Since MCMC does not require Internet Protocol, in this sense, MCMC is _not_ IoT.

### MCMC's Contribution
MCMC will contribute blockchain computing, for instance, MCMC will supply CPU power to miners,
or cats and dogs weared devices and coils might be suppliers.
Then MCMC will be designed for the purpose of the application.
Considering its application, MCMC will pay attention to the security against any and all attack.

### Our goal
This project has another great goal for developers.
It is our goal that we study how we work as cooperative in a large organization as each of MCMC devices contoributes
complex application.

### Starting up
This project will start up a implementation of simple 5 stages RISC architecture.

### key words
computer architecture, distributed computing, micro computer, RISC, logic circuit, machine language, IoT, blockchain, miner, information security
