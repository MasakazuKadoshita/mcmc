# MCMC (Mass Cooperative Micro Computing)
---

MCMC is next generation open source computer architecture.
MCMC means Mass Cooperative Micro Computing.

## About MCMC
---

MCMC consists of a large amount of small devices equipped parts of a micro computer (or Micro Processor Unit).
Mass devices (some of them have different parts) cooperatively work as complete computers.

MCMC stands on communications of things in a machine language.
MCMC does not require Internet Protocol, in this sense, MCMC is _not_ IoT.

MCMC will contribute blockchain computing, for instance, MCMC will supply CPUPower to miners,
or cats and dogs weared devices and coils might be suppliers.
Then MCMC will be designed for the purpose of the application.
Considering its application, MCMC will pay attention to the security against any and all attack.

This project will start up a implementation of simple 5 stages RISC architecture.

### key words

## Outline
---
Let's get started MCMC.
We'll build a MCMC system that simulates RISC architecture.
We'll design MCMC devices in top-down way, and implement them in bottom-up way.
We suppose simple RISC architecture that has 5 pipeline stages.

### Table of pipelines stage

| Stage Code	| Stage Name        	| text	|
|-----------	|-------------------	|-----	|
| IF        	| Instruction  Fetch 	|     	|
| D         	| Instruction  Decode	|     	|
| EX        	| Execute           	|     	|
| MEM       	| Memory Access     	|     	|
| WB        	| Writeback         	|     	|

MCMC devices communicate on a network called MCMC Net in its machine language.
MCMC Net's topology will be any type, that will be bus, star, ring, MST(Minimum Spanning Tree), or other innovative one.

Those who equipped IO unit communicate with IoT.
Those who equipped memory unit communicate with IoT.
Those who equipped CPU unit work as a core of a multiple core machine.

A RISC's CPU consists of control unit, buffer unit, data bus and MPU.
Those who equipped control unit act controller.
Those who equipped buffer unit store data to IO devices and memory devices.
Those who equipped data bus carry data among CPU.
Those who equipped MPU execute instractions.
If possible, some MCMC devices have parts of MPU, in that
they have logic circuit corresponding to one or more pipeline stage.
In this case, there is advantage to communication because each devices represents its pipeline stage.
This means that there addresses can be used as a part of machine language.
